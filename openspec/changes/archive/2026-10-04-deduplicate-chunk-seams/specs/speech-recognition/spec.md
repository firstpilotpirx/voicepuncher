## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Long recordings are transcribed in chunks
The system SHALL split a dictation or a recording file longer than the chunk threshold into overlapping chunks, transcribe each through the service, and merge the results without duplicating words at the seams, even when the service transcribes the overlapping audio differently in the two chunks. Where two chunks share no words, the merge SHALL keep every word of both.

#### Scenario: Dictation longer than the chunk threshold
- **WHEN** the user dictates for longer than the chunk threshold
- **THEN** the raw transcript contains every spoken word once, in order

#### Scenario: Chunks transcribe the overlap differently
- **GIVEN** a dictation longer than the chunk threshold, in Russian or in English
- **AND** the service transcribes the overlapping audio differently in the two chunks: other punctuation or case, another spelling, a word cut short at the chunk edge, or a different reading of a word
- **WHEN** the dictation is transcribed
- **THEN** the overlapping words appear once in the raw transcript
- **AND** the words before and after the overlap are kept

#### Scenario: Chunks share no words
- **GIVEN** a dictation longer than the chunk threshold whose chunk transcripts share no words at the seam
- **WHEN** the dictation is transcribed
- **THEN** the raw transcript contains every word of every chunk, in order

#### Scenario: Recording file longer than the chunk threshold
- **GIVEN** a recording file of Russian or English speech longer than the chunk threshold
- **WHEN** the user transcribes the recording file
- **THEN** the recording is transcribed in chunks
- **AND** the printed text repeats no phrase of the speech and misses at most one spoken word in ten

#### Scenario: Long speech under difficult recording conditions
- **GIVEN** a recording file of Russian or English speech longer than the chunk threshold, spoken slowly or fast, with pauses between sentences or between words, with low or high background noise, through a phone-quality line, quietly, clipped, or with short audio dropouts
- **WHEN** the user transcribes the recording file
- **THEN** the printed text repeats no phrase of the speech
- **AND** it misses at most one spoken word in ten

#### Scenario: Chunk seams fall on different words
- **GIVEN** Russian or English speech longer than the chunk threshold, spoken at different rates or with pauses
- **AND** the speech starts after different lead-ins, so the chunk seams fall on different words
- **WHEN** the speech is transcribed in chunks
- **THEN** the raw transcript repeats no phrase of the speech
- **AND** the merge drops at most one in fifty spoken words beyond those the chunk transcripts already missed
